# AKS Engine on Azure Stack Hub - Best Practices

The purpose of this document is to provide a light weight guide to AKS on Azure Stack Hub deployment. The best, in depth, source for guidance is the [Azure Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-stack/user/azure-stack-kubernetes-aks-engine-overview?view=azs-2008) which I used to create this summary content. Another source I referenced was the [Azure Intelligent Edge Patterns](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-intelligent-edge-patterns/tree/master/AKSe-on-AzStackHub) guide. Think of this content as the CliffsNotesâ„¢ version of those two docs.
