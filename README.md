# AKS Engine on Azure Stack Hub - Best Practices

> **_NOTE:_** The purpose of this document is to provide a light weight guide to AKS on Azure Stack Hub deployment. The best, in depth, source for guidance is the [Azure Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-stack/user/azure-stack-kubernetes-aks-engine-overview?view=azs-2008) which I used to create this summary content. Think of this content as the CliffsNotesâ„¢ version.

## Getting started

The first decision to make when looking to run Kubernetes on Azure Stack Hub (henceforth ASH) is to determine which approach you want to take for cluster lifecycle management (i.e. Cluster Create, Update, Scale, Delete). You have various options, including tools that target bare metal and virtual machine based deployments, like [k3s](https://k3s.io/). In this guide our focus will be on the Azure Native options:

* Azure Kubernetes Service Engine
* AKS Resource Provider for Azure Stack Hub 

As the AKS Resource provider is still in preview, we'll be focusing on the AKS Engine option for cluster lifecycle management.

## AKS Engine on ASH Support

AKS Engine is an open source project run by Microsoft, so it typically would not have standard support beyond the open source issue process. However, as a mechanism for running AKS on ASH there is support available. For the full details see the [support policy document](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-stack/user/azure-stack-kubernetes-aks-engine-support?view=azs-2008) provided by the Azure Stack Hub team.

## Pre-reqs: Getting ready to install AKS Engine on Azure Stack Hub

The Azure documentation is very thorough in providing the steps needed to install AKS on Azure Stack Hub, but lets highlight a few key points.

1. Review the prerequisites documented [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-stack/user/azure-stack-kubernetes-aks-engine-set-up?view=azs-2008), which in summary tells you to confirm the following:

    * ASH is on version 1910 or later (See the AKS Engine to ASH version mapping [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-stack/user/kubernetes-aks-engine-release-notes?view=azs-2008#aks-engine-and-azure-stack-version-mapping))
    * ASH has the Linux Custom Script Extension v2 installed from the Marketplace
    * Service Principal has been created with Contributor Rights on your target ASH Resource Group
    * An SSH private/public key pair is available, which you will pass in the public key on cluster creation to be used at the cluster access token

    | Azure Stack Hub version                    | AKS engine version         |
    |------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
    | 1910                                           | 0.43.0, 0.43.1                 |
    | 2002                                           | 0.48.0, 0.51.0                 |
    | 2005                                           | 0.48.0, 0.51.0, 0.55.0, 0.55.4 |
    | 2008                                           | 0.55.4, 0.60.1                 |
<br></br>
2. Choose a version of Kubernetes you'd like to install. If this is your first cluster, you should align with the latest supported version, however you may be limited based on the base OS images available in your ASH Marketplace. Review the following two lists to help you choose.

   * You can see the full list of AKS Engine to base OS image mappings [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-stack/user/kubernetes-aks-engine-release-notes?view=azs-2008#aks-engine-and-corresponding-image-mapping)
   * You can see details on the AKS Engine and aligned Kubernetes supported versions for Azure Stack Hub [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-stack/user/kubernetes-aks-engine-release-notes?view=azs-2008#aks-engine-and-azure-stack-version-mapping)

<br></br>

3. In order to simplify the AKS Engine deployment process (i.e. Networking, DNS, Security), best practice is to create a jump box on your ASH instance that you can use for running AKS Engine. This jump box can be either Linux or Windows, and creation steps are available at the following:

    >Note: Before using these guides, make sure you know what AKS Engine version you plan to use, as you'll need that version number during the setup.
   
   * [Create a Linux Client](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-stack/user/azure-stack-kubernetes-aks-engine-deploy-linux?view=azs-2008)
   * [Create a Windows Client](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-stack/user/azure-stack-kubernetes-aks-engine-deploy-windows?view=azs-2008)

4. Finally, for our walk through we're making the assumption that you want to deploy to an existing Virtual Network in your Azure Stack Hub. By default AKS Engine will create a Vnet for you if you don't specify one, but it's rare to see that done in production deployments. In this Vnet you'll need a subnet for your control plane (master nodes) and a subnet for your worker nodes. The size will vary based on the network plugin you choose:

    * Kubenet(default): This network plugin provides an overlay network within the cluster, where an address space is assigned to a bridge network and all traffic in and out of the cluster goes through NAT to the individual node IP. IP space allocated should be at 1 IP per node, plus 1 IP for the cluster load balancer. 
    * Azure CNI: This network plugin allows the cluster to assign IP to pods using the subnet the cluster is deployed into via a virtual ethernet device in transparent mode. In this configuration you'll have 1 IP for each node plus an IP for each pod on a node (default: 30 pods per node), plus 1 IP for the cluster load balancer. 

    More details available [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/concepts-network)

## Time to deploy the cluster!

The first thing you'll need, now that you have AKS Engine installed on a jump box, is an AKS Engine Cluster Specification (aka. API Model). The cluster specification is a file that we use to tell AKS engine how we want the cluster to be configured, including key options like the following:

* Kubernetes Version
* Cluster OS
* Control Plane Node Count
* Worker Node Count
* Network Plugin
* Network Policy

>**_IMPORTANT:_** The cluster specification is initially used for creating the cluster, but a new cluster specification file is created for you as an output of the cluster creation process. THIS is the file you should use for future cluster operations, like upgrade and scale operations.

The Azure Stack team maintains an example cluster specification in the AKS Engine Git Repo. Make sure you select the appropriate branch for your version of AKS Engine, and then go to 'examples/azure-stack'.

* [AKS Engine on ASH Deployment Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-stack/user/azure-stack-kubernetes-aks-engine-deploy-cluster?view=azs-2008)
* [AKS Engine v0.60.1 on ASH Sample Cluster Specification](https://github.com/Azure/aks-engine/blob/patch-release-v0.60.1/examples/azure-stack/kubernetes-azurestack.json)

Once you've downloaded your relevant cluster specification file, continue following the above referenced AKS on ASH deployment guide to update the file with relevant parameters, which includes the following:

* ASH Portal Fully Qualified Domain Name
* Cluster Version and Size Details
* Master and Worker Vnet/Subnet Resource IDs
* Master First Consecutive IP
* Service Principal ID and Secret
  
```bash
# Load some environment variables to be used in the deployment
RG=<Target Resource Group Name>
LOC=<Azure Stack Hub Target Instance>
CLIENT_ID=<Service Principal Client ID>
CLIENT_SECRET=<Service Principal Client Secret>
SUB_ID=<Subscription ID>

# Deploy the cluster
# Note that I use the resource group name
# for the output directory. 
aks-engine deploy \
--azure-env AzureStackCloud \
--location $LOC \
--resource-group $RG \
--api-model ./kubernetes-azurestack.json \
--output-directory $RG \
--client-id $CLIENT_ID \
--client-secret $CLIENT_SECRET \
--subscription-id $SUB_ID
```

The above deploy command will create an output directory containing the following:

* **_apimodel.json_** - This API model represents the current state of the cluster and should be used for all future operations against the cluster
* **_azuredeploy.json_** - This is an Azure Resource Manager template used to create the Azure resources
* **_azuredeploy.parameters.json_** - Parameters file for the above noted Azure deployment template
* **_kubeconfig directory_** - This directory holds your Kubernetes config file which can be used to access the cluster via [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/kubectl/)
* Various certificate files that were created as part of the cluster creation process

To access your cluster:

1. Install [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/kubectl/)
2. Tell kubectl where your config file is:
  
   * Option 1: Copy the kubeconfig json document to ~/.kube/config (the default location for Kubernetes config files)
        ```bash
        cp <aks engine output directory>/kubeconfig/<configfilename>.json ~/.kube/config
        ```
   * Option 2: Use the KUBECONFIG environment variable to tell kubectl where the file is
        ```bash
        export KUBECONFIG=<aks engine output directory>/kubeconfig/<configfilename>.json
        ```
   * Option 3: Merge your new file into an existing config file, although I've found this to be a bit inconsistent
        ```bash
        # Add all of the config files to the KUBECONFIG path
        export KUBECONFIG=~/<path to config file 1>/<filename>.json:~/<path to config file 2>/<filename>.json
        # Use the config view tool with the flatten option to merge and output to a single file
        kubectl config view --merge --flatten > ~/.kube/config
        # Now we reset the KUBECONFIG environment variable to the default path
        export KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/config
        ```
        >Note: The above approach may not work if one config file is yaml and the other is json.
